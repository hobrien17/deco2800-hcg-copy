/**
 * The Character abstract class is to be extended by all Characters, both
 * playable and non playable. Character extends AbstractEntity so that the
 * characters may be rendered to the game world.
 *
 * Characters have attributes and skills as listed below, skills and attributes
 * are used to calculate numerous stats in the background such as movement
 * speed, health, stamina, and damages with various weapons.
 *
 * NPCs do not have to gain xp or level up but they should have a level
 * (possibly displayed in game) that represents its difficulty.
 *
 * The character's level will increment by 1 once the player's xp reaches
 * the level up threshold.
 * The character's experience will tick over to 0 once the level up threshold is reached (level up thresholds TBD).
 * The character's health is determined by the character's level and vitality attribute.
 * The character's stamina is determined by the character's level and agility attribute.
 * The character's strength will increase the character's damage with with melee weapons and also determines how much
 * the player can have in their inventory.
 * Vitality determines how much health is gained per level.
 * Agility Determines how much the character's stamina is increased by each level, and also determines the
 * character's movement speed.
 * Charisma  Determines how well the character's interactions with other characters go.
 * Intellect determines how many skill points the player has to distribute to their skills each level.
 * meleeSkill determines how much damage the character does with melee weapons.
