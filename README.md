# Hardcore Gardening

So she wept as the final winds drew the leaves down from the tree like snow, soon to melt away. Not for a year, but for until the clocks had run out of revolutions. 

It was the eye of the storm, but like her maker's, one that was now omnipresent. With this she realised, it was the wild gusts that kept her going, the terror that made her tick. As peace comes, her essential being leaves.

Where was there to go now? A survey of each direction provided a look into this peace that for so long she had sought, but even longer it will remain. 

Mind the gap between mind and matter, 

Her feet began to carry her towards where the trollies used to chatter. 

Down the road she used to go, to the people who used to know,

Planks and fittings and air compressors,

Building the garden where flora glow,

Glow snubbed out as the mold took over,

Nothing left, no single clover,

Her feet didn't care to go where it started,

Where cheap sausages were consumed as customers departed,

It was a war she was supposed to be winning,

From the store where lowest prices were just the beginning,

Succumbing to the pain she could no longer douse,

She collapsed before the BUNNINGS WAREHOUSE.
